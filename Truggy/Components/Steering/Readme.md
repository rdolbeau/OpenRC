In here in the steering system

 * Steering Block.B.4.stl: You'll need 2 of those (one for each wheel)
 * Steering_Pin.A.0.stl: You'll need 2 of those (one for each side)
 * Updated Steering.A.3.stl: Many elements in one go, you'll only need one. One of the parts already has built-in support. If you need to replace one of the parts, or want your own support, you'll need to regenerate the STL from the original STEP file in a CAD program rather than print this.

You'll also need a servo holder for the servo (see in ../Electronics Holders).
