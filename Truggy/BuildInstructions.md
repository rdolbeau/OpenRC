# Build Instructions
## Differential
 * [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_myFCZTWo&feature=youtu.be)


## Chassis
 * You need 5 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 on each side, to connect the front and back plate to the left and right shield (10 screws in all)
 * You need 4 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 to connect the back chassis plate to the back differential housing, and 4 Hexagon Nut M3 to go on the sides of the housing (not sure is M3x8 is quite long enough, but that's what's in the CAD file)
 * You need 4 Pan Head Cap Screw M3x10 to connect the fron chassis plate to the front differential housing, and 4 Hexagon Nut M3 to go on the sides of the
 housing
 * You need 6 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 to connect the front & back chassis plate to the central differential housing

## Steering
 * You need 2 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 to attach the front chassis plate to the steering columns ; you can use slightly longer screw such as M3x12 but they will be harder to screw properly in the plastic
 * the 4 6x12x4 bearings are used here for the steering system
 * 4 more Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 are required, two to add the upper part to the columns, and two more for the horizontal bar

## Front differential
 * There's a helpful document to assemble the differential itself under "Components/Differential/Documentation/OpenRC Differential Assembly.pdf" (and the video linked above)
 * First you need to put in the central drive shaft joint & input gear. The pair is assembled by a Pan Head Cap Screw M3x12, and rotates inside a pair of 10x15x4 bearings
 * Then you can put the differential itself in (it also has a pair of 10x15x4 bearings)
 * Use 2 Countersunk Head Screw M3x12 to assemble the horizontal bar at the bottom front
 * Use 2 Pan Head Screw M3x16 a the top to assemble the second part of the housing, plus 2 Hexagon Nut M3. Note that you also need assemble the front shock tower at this point, and it has a front and a back so beware
 * Use a Countersunk Head Screw M3x6 to assemble the top to the bottom at the front, above the horizontal bar
