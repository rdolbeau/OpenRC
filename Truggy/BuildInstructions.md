## Chassis
 * You need 5 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 on each side, to connect the front and back plate to the left and right shield (10 screws in all)
 * You need 4 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 to connect the back chassis plate to the back differential housing, and 4 Hexagon Nut M3 to go on the sides of the housing (not sure is M3x8 is quite long enough, but that's what's in the CAD file)
 * You need 4 Pan Head Cap Screw M3x10 to connect the fron chassis plate to the front differential housing, and 4 Hexagon Nut M3 to go on the sides of the
 housing
 * You need 6 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 to connect the front & back chassis plate to the central differential housing

## Steering
 * You need 2 Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 to attach the front chassis plate to the steering columns ; you can use slightly longer screw such as M3x12 but they will be harder to screw properly in the plastic
 * the 4 6x12x4 bearings are used here for the steering system
 * 4 more Countersunk Head Screw M3x8 are required, two to add the upper part to the columns, and two more for the horizontal bar
